        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect rice leaf diseases. 
            Early detection of diseases like Bacterial Leaf Blight, Brown Spot, and Smut helps farmers 
            take preventive measures, improving yield and quality.

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            1️⃣ **Upload an Image** of a rice leaf.<br>
            2️⃣ Our **CNN-based deep learning model** analyzes the image.<br>
            3️⃣ The system **classifies the disease** and provides recommendations.<br>
            4️⃣ Farmers can take **preventive measures** based on results.
